# Necronomicon Mod Template
A fork of https://github.com/txnimc/TxniTemplate, used as my main multiloader template for my mods working along Necronomicon API.

## Steps to configure:
1. Replace values accordingly in gradle.properties
2. Run the "renameExampleMod" task
3. Replace project name in settings.gradle.kts

You can change the license of the mod as you'd like, it is defined in LICENSE.md.
This template is licensed under the MIT License, and can be defined in LICENSE_TEMPLATE.md.
